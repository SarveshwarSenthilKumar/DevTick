- Task management system designed for developers to organize their work and track project progress.
- Categories for different coding tasks, from bug fixes to new feature development.

### üìö Contact Book
- A space to store and organize contacts, like collaborators, mentors, or clients.
- Ability to store contact details, GitHub profiles, LinkedIn, or other relevant links.

### üîë API Key Management
- Secure storage and organization of API keys for the projects you're working on.
- Ability to add notes or descriptions for each API key to remind developers of usage, limits, and restrictions.

### üí° Project Ideas
- A section for users to add and brainstorm new project ideas.

### üî® Project Categories
- Organize projects based on categories such as:
  - **Web Development**
  - **Mobile Development**
  - **AI/ML Projects**
  - **Open Source Contributions**
- This will help developers find and focus on relevant types of work.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Text Chat

## Future Enhancements:
- **Collaboration Tools:** Ability to share project ideas and tasks with teams for easier collaboration.
- **Code Snippet Library:** A place to store and share reusable code snippets or templates.
- **Code Review Integration:** Integrate with GitHub/GitLab to make it easy to manage pull requests or code reviews.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
  - A lightweight Python web framework that makes it easy to develop APIs and web applications.
  
- **Database:** SQLite3
  - SQLite3 is used for local, lightweight database management. It will store user health data, preferences, and AI-generated recommendations.

- **Frontend:** HTML and CSS
  - Simple, clean HTML and CSS will be used to build the user interface. Future enhancements could include JavaScript and front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SarveshwarSenthilKumar/DevTick.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DevTick
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the app.

## Flask Development Template
For this project, I used the **[Flask Development Template](https://github.com/SarveshwarSenthilKumar/Flask-Development-Template)** as the base template for building the backend. The template provides a solid foundation for developing Flask applications with best practices, including structure for routing, database handling, and integration with various extensions like Flask-Migrate for database migrations.
